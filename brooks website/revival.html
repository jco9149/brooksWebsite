                                                    <h3>Could there be <strong>ANYTHING<strong> as needed today like <strong>REVIVAL?!<strong></h3>
                                                </header>
                                                <p> With all the trials our nation is facing and with the constant bombardment of life altering changes concerning our day to day life as americans; could there be anything like revival to provide us with great peace and comfort? Our family here at Brooks is convinced (more than <Strong>EVER BEFORE<strong>) That our <strong> ONLY <strong> hope in todays negative filled world is a spritual revival in our Lord and saviour Jesus Christ.  </p>
                                                    <p> We have planned this revival as a way to gather those in our local community who seek peace, answers, and hope. Our world has never been so ever-chagning. What normal day to day life we lived yesterday has been radically changed. We as a nation are more distant, divided, confused than ever before. We have far more questions than we have answers, and the looming question on the heart of many people is "What hope do we have to see us through such troubled times? " </p>
                                                    <p> There is a <strong>GREAT HOPE<strong> in the name of Jesus Christ. As a matter of fact The Bible tells us that in Jesus Christ we have a BLESSED HOPE! Titus 2:13 We need a message of pure hope one to lift up the human sprirt and remind us that no matter how bad things get and how far the world may stray from God that we still have HOPE IN CHRIST. No matter how challenging the last few months may have been for you and your family we're here to tell you of the Gospel (THE GOOD NEWS) of Christ. John 3:16 tells us that God loved the world (YOU) so much that he gave is only begotten Son that whosoever beleiveth on him should not perish, but have everlasting life. God loves you and wants to reveal himself to you! </p>
                                                        
                                                        <p> Would you come and join us for this revival? We would love for you to come and and get revived with us in the sprirt of God for there is no greater time than NOW to hear what God has to say to his people. We ask that you come at least one night and be our guest as we have some of the most vetted Preachers joing us each night to lead in our services and beleive us when we say.... this wont be something you want to miss. We are praying for you and hope that in time you will decide to come join our family in praise and fellowship. May God continue to bless you through these troubled times.
